Hello and welcome to my FPROG Project,

> This is an F# application, so you will need .NET installed, if not, follow this link: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download

> check this by entering "dotnet" in the console, an options message should appear.

> After that, run "dotnet run -- <path> <filetype>" in the project folder and you are good to go, the project should compile,
  create bin and obj folders and run in the console.

> NOTE: the given path is relative to the project, not absolute (e.g. /samples). And the filetype starts with a dot (e. g.: .txt; .csv; .pdf) 

> The results of the program are saved inside the project directory under "result.csv"
> to run the program and open the results you may run the "demo.bat" script.
